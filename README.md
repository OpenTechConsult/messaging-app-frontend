# Messaging App with MERN - Front-end part.

Welcome to our awesome messaging app built with MERN stack. This part of the application is the front-end part. It is responsible for displaying the messages and sending new ones.

The front-end is generated using **`yarn create react-app`** tool. It is a simple React app with a single page built using redux.

[Material-UI](https://mui.com) will provide the icons in the application.

Since a chat application needs a real-time database (like firebase), and since we decided to use MongoDB as a backend database, we will supplement it with [Pusher](https://pusher.com/).

**messaging-app-frontend** is functional chat application with google authentication so that different users can login and chat with their Google accounts to chat.
